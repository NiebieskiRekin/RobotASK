# Robot ASK - Piano tiles

A Piano Tiles (mobile game) hardware autoclicker built on the ATmega328. All electrical sketches and the PCB were designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Code for the microprocessor was written in C++ using Arduino and Servo libraries as well as the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) VSCode extension.

This repository was created for a university group project for [RoboDay 2024](https://www.facebook.com/events/1518830758974874) at Poznań University of Technology.
